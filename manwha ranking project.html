<h1>The best romance manwhas of all time by Serena Sama !!!</h1>
<h2>My top 3 manwhas of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Vilainess is a Marionette</h3>
<p>The plot is amazing, i cant lie. The main character is such a beauty from another deimension. Don't even get me started with the male leads kyaaaa</p>

<h3>Rewritting the vilainess</h3>
<p>The ending was so sad. I felt so bad for Ji-eun. One of my favourite male leads ever, will i be able to found one on this earth ?</p>

<h3>Just Twilight</h3>
<p>OH MY DAYS, i could read this over and over again. The main characters are just so fit for each other.</p>
